## Context

This project is one of the assignments of the course *Fundamental Topics
in Multimedia Systems* at the [Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t](https://www.aau.at/en/) in Klagenfurt, Austria.
The goal of this project is to implement a JPEG compression algorithm in Python.

**Why Python?**

It is imposed by our teacher. I would have preferred to use C++, so it would be
faster, but more complex to implement.
