This project was pretty basic, but yet we didn't do
all the things we wanted to do.
It is very frustrating to have not succeeded to save the binary
file to compare file sizes.
Instead of that, it is also frustrating to have used Python instead
of C++ for example. Even if it is simpler, it is not as fast as C++.
Though, we are very happy to have succeeded to do the compression
and finish this project (in about 9h30 of coding, and much more
documenting).
